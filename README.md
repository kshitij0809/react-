A declarative cross-platform react-native datetime-picker.

## Description

This library exposes a cross-platform interface for showing the native date-picker and time-picker inside a modal.
You will have an unified user experience, you won't have to worry anymore about testing the device platform and you won't have to programmatically call the Android TimePicker/DatePicker APIs.



## Setup

This library is available on npm, install it with `npm install --save react-native-modal-datetime-picker` or `yarn add react-native-modal-datetime-picker`.
